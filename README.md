### Description
> Project to create an xkcd random password generator with various user options to manipulate the password.  Utilizes PHP code server side to scrape random words from websites and files on the server and spit them out to the user.  Allows the user to cater the password to their needs by allowing them to change case, add numbers, choose their separator value, and/or add special characters.

>  Background information:

> xkcd, the self proclaimed "webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language", produced a comic strip questioning the modern trend of password complexity titled “Password Strength”.  Their opinion is that there is a threshold at which the 'entropic' value (the level of randomness that would create difficulty for brute force password guessing) of a password gets overshadowed by its ability to actually be remembered by the user.  They go further to propose a strategy that provides both a higher value of entropy and an easier means by which to remember said password.  

> The example that the comic presents to showcase their theory consists of a complex string of alphanumeric characters, “Tr0ub4dor83”, contrasted with a seemingly ridiculous statement, “correct horse battery staple”.  The logic is that the alphanumeric mashup password, given its shorter length, provides a much easier password for a brute force algorithm to guess versus the longer “semi-ridiculous” and multi-word password.  Based on their calculation, even without the random numbers/special characters, the longer password construct provides a much greater level of protection while also allowing for easier remembrance by simply creating an image in your mind of the phrase.  Their estimate depicts a brute force algorithm of 1,000 guess/second taking about 550 years to guess the longer easier-to-remember password, while at the same guesses/second, the shorter more complex password could potentially be cracked in about three days.
